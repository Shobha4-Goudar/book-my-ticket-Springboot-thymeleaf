while admins manage movies, theaters, screens, seat layouts, and users.

Technologies Used:
Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL, Spring Security

Key Features:
Role-based authentication for Admin and User
OTP-based email verification using JavaMailSender
Movie and theater image upload using Cloudinary
Online ticket booking with Razorpay payment gateway
Real-time seat selection and booking
QR code generation for ticket confirmation
Admin user management (block/unblock users)

Integrations:
Razorpay, Cloudinary, JavaMailSender, QR Code Generator

Short Explanation:
Book My Ticket is an online movie ticket booking application developed using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. 
It has two modules: Admin and User.
Admins can manage movies, theaters, screens, seat layouts, and users, while users can register using OTP-based email verification,
view available shows, book seats, make payments using Razorpay, and receive QR-coded tickets. Cloudinary is used for image storage,
and MySQL is used for database management.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detailed Explanation:
This project is a full-stack Spring Boot application with Thymeleaf as the frontend.
It has two roles: Admin and User.
The Admin module allows admins to log in securely and manage movies, theaters, screens, seat layouts, and show timings. 
Admins can also view registered users and block or unblock them.
The User module allows users to register and verify their email using OTP sent via JavaMailSender. 
After login, users can browse movies, select shows, choose seats, and proceed with booking.

For payments, Razorpay is integrated to handle secure online transactions. Once payment is successful, 
a booking is created and a QR code is generated for the ticket, which can be used for entry validation.

Images of movies and theaters are stored in Cloudinary to reduce server load. MySQL is used for storing user,
 booking, show, and payment data using JPA and Hibernate.

Architecture Explanation:

Controller Layer → Handles requests
Service Layer → Business logic
Repository Layer → Database operations using JPA
Frontend → Thymeleaf templates
Database → MySQL, Redis

Q1: Why did you choose Spring Boot?

Answer:
Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code, provides auto-configuration, and makes application development faster and easier.

Q2: Why Thymeleaf instead of React?

Answer:
Thymeleaf integrates easily with Spring Boot, supports server-side rendering, and is suitable for monolithic applications.


Q3: How is OTP verification implemented?

Answer:
OTP is generated during registration and sent via JavaMailSender to the user’s email. The user must verify it to activate the account.

🔸 Payment & Booking
Q4: How does Razorpay payment flow work?

Answer:
An order is created on the server, payment is completed on Razorpay, and the payment signature is verified before confirming the booking.

Q5: How do you prevent double booking of seats?

Answer:
Seat availability is checked before booking and seats are marked as booked after successful payment.

🔸 Cloudinary & QR Code
Q6: Why Cloudinary?

Answer:
To store images securely in the cloud and reduce server storage and load.

Q7: Why QR code in tickets?

Answer:
QR codes help in quick ticket verification and reduce fraud.

🔸 Database & JPA
Q8: What entities are used?

Answer:
User, Movie, Theater, Screen, Seat, Show, Booking, Payment.


🔸 Advanced / Tricky Questions
Q9: What improvements can be made?

Answer:
JWT authentication, REST APIs, React frontend, seat locking, ticket cancellation, refunds, and deployment on AWS.

Q10: How would you scale this application?

Answer:
Use microservices, caching (Redis), load balancing, and cloud deployment.
